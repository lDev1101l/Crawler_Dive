Welome traveller!
This is my Project that just for now involves only the Web crawler itself. 
In the future I may add a Scraper or any other features, so stay tuned if you`re interested ;) 

And some explanation aswell:

The project theme was chosen for several reasons:

`Learning the Basics of Web Scraping`: The project provides an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how web scraping and web crawling work, how to extract data from web pages, work with HTML, and manage HTTP requests.

`Practice working with libraries`: HtmlAgilityPack is a powerful library for working with HTML documents in C#.

`Managing Recursion and Data Structures`: The web crawler uses recursion and collections to track visited URLs. This will help improve your understanding of these topics.

`Error and Exception Handling`: The code provides basic exception handling. You can improve it by adding logging and more accurate handling of various errors.

`Extensibility`: The code is easily extended and modified. 
You can add features such as:
-Time limit for crawling.
-Additional criteria for selecting links.
-Saving data to a database or files.
-Processing and analysis of collected data.

`Improving Programming Skills`: Working with a real project helps improve programming skills, code debugging and testing.
